# Kraken
Kraken is a lightweight front-end boilerplate to help you start your responsive web projects.

It includes just the essentials:

* A CSS reset to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
* A responsive, mobile-first grid.
* A well-designed, fluid typographic scale.
* CSS3 buttons.
* Basic form styling

### Designed to Expand

CSS frameworks often include a lot more stuff than you need, and a lot of boilerplates are missing a lot of stuff you want.

Kraken was built to be lightweight but expandable. It includes links to a variety of tools that were designed to work together - icon-fonts, navigation menus, dropdowns, toggle tabs and more.

## How It Works
Getting started with Kraken is really easy. [View the online tutorial](http://cferdinandi.github.com/origami/) or dig through the example.html file.
